# Test cases for Gromacs benchmarks
We use the following input files for Gromacs performance evaluations.   
1. Benchmark set from [Max Planck GROMACS Benchmark Suite](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/grubmueller/bench), including benchMEM (82k atoms), benchPEP (12M atoms), benchPEP-h (12M atoms, h-bouds constrained) etc. Please visit the [bench website](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/grubmueller/bench) to download the benchmarks and get further details.   
2. STMV - Satellite Tobacco Mosaic Virus (STMV) has about 1M atoms and is available from [Supplementary Information for Heterogeneous Parallelization and Acceleration of Molecular Dynamics Simulations in GROMACS](https://zenodo.org/record/3893789).
