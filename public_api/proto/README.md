# Public gRPC APIs

The .proto files here specify public gRPC APIs. These are APIs
accessible over the Internet. Note that some of these APIs may not
be user accessible. Internal IDC APIs that need to be accessed from
external regions (such as global APIs) are defined here.

The .proto files are stored outside of the go top-level directory
because protobufs are platform independent. We may have code in
other languages that are gRPC clients and/or implement gPRC
services.

devcloud-grpc-swagger.json is autogenerated by running `make generate`.
