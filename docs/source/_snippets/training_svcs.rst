Training content includes:

* :ref:`jupyter_learning` environment orientation
* Introduction to a specific AI/ML topic, like developing Stable Diffusion Models
* Explanation of :ref:`accounts` benefits (e.g., memory, number of cards, core compute, etc.) by tier level
* Instruction on incorporating supplemental services for AI/ML pipelines, model training and inference, or app development

Training Workshops
******************

Our team collaborates with universities, research institutions, and companies to bring
effective, focused training in AI/ML workflows.

* Visit `Learning`_ to view Jupyter Notebooks training
* Engage Training Services for an interactive workshop (generally, two hours' duration)

Scope
*****

Our training workshops are generally held for about two hours. Workshop content varies, depending on the original request.

   Coupon code

Ben O - In this doc, please help to decide if we should instruct users on how to obtain a coupon code (as above) for the Gaudi 2 Accelerator.

Also,  I'm not sure if we should describe why/how we give out a coupon in a workshop. Reason? We need the doc to clearly support only one rhetorical angle: inform/instruct; describe; but not both.

    TODO: Ben - In this doc, we need to decide if we should instruct users on how to obtain a coupon code
    --at least for the Gaudi 2 Accelerator -- because this is above an beyond giving a workshop where a coupon is provided.
