Connect to Instance
********************

#. View your instance in the :guilabel:`Instances` tab.

#. Assure your instance :guilabel:`State` shows **Ready**.

   .. tip::
      See :ref:`instance_states` for more details.

#. Choose a method to connect to your instance:

.. _one_click_header:

One-Click Connection
====================

Using this method, you connect to your instance in a JupyterLab environment.

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Instances` tab.

#. Wait until your instance name shows :guilabel:`Ready`.

#. Click on your instance name.

#. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

   a. Optional: Click on the :guilabel:`Connect` button in the row where your instance appears. A JupyterLab environment will launch.

   .. tip::
      You must select "One-Click connection" before launching an instance for this option to be available.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Terminal` icon to access your instance.

#. You're all set. Start exploring.

.. _set_up_ssh_keys:

Set Up SSH Keys
===============

Configure SSH keys in two steps. First, create an SSH key locally. Second, upload it to your account. Setting up an SSH Key is a one-time task.

.. warning::

   Never share your private keys with anyone. Never create a SSH Private key without a passphrase.

* Apply a :ref:`load_balancer` to your instance
* Start exploring use cases in :ref:`tutorials`.

Optional Steps
**************

Access via Corporate Network
============================

If you're connecting to |ITAC| from your company Corporate Network, you'll need to update SSH config file.

.. note::

   If you connect using PowerShell on Microsoft Windows Operating System, you must install `gitforwindows`.

#. SSH Configuration is an one-time task.

#. Your SSH configuration file is in a folder named :file:`.ssh` under your user's home folder. If the file is not present, create one.

#. Copy and paste the following to SSH config file:

   .. code-block:: console

      ~/.ssh/config

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Linux\* OS

         .. code-block:: console

            Host 146.152.*.*
            ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -x PROXYSERVER:PROXYSPORT %h %p

      .. tab:: Windows

         .. code-block:: console

            Host 146.152.*.*

            ProxyCommand "C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\connect.exe" -S PROXYSERVER:PROXYSPORT %h %pâ€ƒ

#. From your Lab Administrator, get PROXYSERVER and PROXYPORT in your Corporate Network for SSH, NOT for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy.

#. Replace PROXYSERVER and PROXYPORT with the information you received from your lab administrator and save the SSH Config file.
