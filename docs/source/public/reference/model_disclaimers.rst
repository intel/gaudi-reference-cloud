Model Disclaimers
#################

The following disclaimers are applicable to any customer who engages in model usage on the |ITAC|.

Disclaimer for Using Stable Diffusion Models
********************************************

Intel offers you the Stable Diffusion Model(s) as a convenience solely for your educational purposes in the context of the AI Playground, and, as such, are provided AS IS without any representations, warranties, or indemnification for your use. You are solely responsible for any liability created by your access to and use of the Stable Diffusion Model(s) or the results of such access and use, and you agree to hold Intel harmless from any and all liability. The stable diffusion models are powerful tools for high-resolution image synthesis, including text-to-image and image-to-image transformations. While they are designed to produce high-quality results, users should be aware of potential limitations:

- **Quality Variation and Limitations**:
  The quality of generated images may vary based on the complexity of the input text or image and the alignment with the model's training data.

- **Licensing and Usage Constraints**:
  Please carefully review the licensing information associated with each model to ensure compliance with all terms and conditions.

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  Consider the ethical implications of the generated content, especially in contexts that may involve sensitive or controversial subjects.

  - *Misuse and Malicious Use*:The model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate misinformation or
    images that create hostile or alienating environments for people.

  - *Out-of-Scope Use*: The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events,
    and the generation of such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.

  - *Bias*: Image generation models can reinforce or exacerbate social biases. Stable Diffusion v1 was trained on
    subsets of `LAION-2B(en)`_ and may not account for non-English speaking communities or cultures affecting the overall output of the model and the accuracy of non-English prompts.

- **Human Rights**:
  Intel is committed to respecting human rights and avoiding causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights. See `Intel’s Global Human Rights Principles`_. Intel’s products and software are intended only to be used in applications that do not cause or contribute to adverse impacts on human rights.

For detailed information on each model's capabilities, limitations, and best practices, please refer to the respective model cards and associated publications linked below.
