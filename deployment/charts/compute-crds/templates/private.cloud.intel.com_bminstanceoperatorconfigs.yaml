                  GroupKindConcurrency is a map from a Kind to the number of concurrent reconciliation
                  allowed for that controller.

                  When a controller is registered within this manager using the builder utilities,
                  users have to specify the type the controller reconciles in the For(...) call.
                  If the object's kind passed matches one of the keys in this map, the concurrency
                  for that controller is set to the number specified.

                  The key is expected to be consistent in form with GroupKind.String(),
                  e.g. ReplicaSet in apps group (regardless of version) would be `ReplicaSet.apps`.

              SyncPeriod determines the minimum frequency at which watched resources are
              reconciled. A lower period will correct entropy more quickly, but reduce
              responsiveness to change if there are many watched resources. Change this
              value only if you know what you are doing. Defaults to 10 hours if unset.
              there will a 10 percent jitter between the SyncPeriod of all controllers
              so that all controllers will not send list requests simultaneously.
